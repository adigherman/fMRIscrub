#' First Example Time Series from the ABIDE
#'
#' A sagittal slice from the fMRI time series for subject 0050048 (Pitt). The
#'  data has been pre-processed with slice time correction, rigid body 
#'  realignment estimation, spatial normalization to MNI space, and linear 
#'  detrending. Subject 0050048 was a typically-developing 11-year-old male. 
#'  The scan has many artifacts. A mask was applied to vectorize the spatial 
#'  dimensions.

#' A sagittal slice from the fMRI time series for subject 0051479 (Caltech). The
#'  data has been pre-processed with slice time correction, rigid body 
#'  realignment estimation, spatial normalization to MNI space, and linear 
#'  detrending. Subject 0051479 was a typically-developing 20-year-old female.
