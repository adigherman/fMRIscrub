`fMRIscrub` is a collection of routines for data-driven scrubbing (projection scrubbing and DVARS), motion scrubbing, and other fMRI denoising strategies such as anatomical CompCor, detrending, and nuisance regression. The data-driven scrubbing methods are also applicable to other outlier detection tasks involving high-dimensional data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fMRIscrub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mandymejia/fMRIscrub")
```

## Quick start guide

``` r
pscrub <- clever(Dat1)
plot(pscrub)
Dat1_cleaned <- Dat1[!pscrub$outlier_flag,]
```
