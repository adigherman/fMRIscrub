Description: Computes leverage, a data-driven measure of outlyingness for 
    high-dimensional data such as fMRI scans. Leverage is thresholded to
    identify artifactual volumes for scrubbing. Also includes routines for other
    common fMRI pre-processing methods such as detrending, FD, DVARS, and 
    anatomical CompCor.
