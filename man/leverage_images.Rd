\title{Calculate the leverage images for each outlier that meets the
 \code{outlier_level} threshold, with 3 (default) being the highest/strictest
and 1 being the lowest.}
\usage{
leverage_images(svd, outliers, outlier_level = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{outlier_level}{The outlier threshold for the images, with 1 (default)
being the lowest/least strict. If no outliers at or above this threshold
exist, no images will be made.}

\item{x}{A clever object.}
}
\value{
A list of three: the mean leverage images for each outlier meeting
 the thresold, the top leverage images, and the indices of the top leverage
 images.
