  abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measures to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial root mean square of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a sum of squares decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the sum of squares at adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects; each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE table, which decomposes the total and global variability into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variability and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a null sampling distribution for DVARS-squared and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computation of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and DSE table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.},

In the proposed method, significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise ROI are considered. The first method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the time series data. With the application of CompCor, the temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the application of CompCor significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for functional BOLD data, there were significantly more activated voxels detected with CompCor as compared to RETROICOR. In comparison to RETROICOR, CompCor has the advantage of not requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations.},

The desired structure is typically generated via manual tracing within this model. When model-based segmentation is applied to human cortical data, problems arise if left-right comparisons are desired. The asymmetry of the human cortex requires that both left and right models of a structure be composed in order to effectively segment the desired structures. Paradoxically, defining a model in both hemi-spheres carries a likelihood of introducing bias to one of the structures. This paper describes a novel technique for creating a symmetric average model in which both hemispheres are equally represented and thus left-right comparison is possible. This work is an extension of that proposed by Guimond et al [1]. Hippocampal segmentation is used as a test-case in a cohort of 118 normal eld-erly subjects and results are compared with expert manual tracing.},

  abstract = {The problem of estimating underlying trends in time series data arises in a variety of disciplines. In this paper we propose a variation on Hodrick\textendash Prescott (H-P) filtering, a widely used method for trend estimation. The proposed \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ trend filtering method substitutes a sum of absolute values (i.e., \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ norm) for the sum of squares used in H-P filtering to penalize variations in the estimated trend. The \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ trend filtering method produces trend estimates that are piecewise linear, and therefore it is well suited to analyzing time series with an underlying piecewise linear trend. The kinks, knots, or changes in slope of the estimated trend can be interpreted as abrupt changes or events in the underlying dynamics of the time series. Using specialized interior-point methods, \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ trend filtering can be carried out with not much more effort than H-P filtering; in particular, the number of arithmetic operations required grows linearly with the number of data points. We describe the method and some of its basic properties and give some illustrative examples. We show how the method is related to \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ regularization-based methods in sparse signal recovery and feature selection, and we list some extensions of the basic method.},

In this article, we illustrate the shortcomings of this approach, as we show how later preprocessing steps can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the data in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each regression step is a geometric projection of data onto a subspace, and that performing a sequence of projections can move the data into subspaces no longer orthogonal to those previously removed, reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates. Thus, linear filtering operations are not commutative, and the order in which the preprocessing steps are performed is critical. These issues can arise in practice when any combination of standard preprocessing steps including motion regression, scrubbing, component-based correction, physiological correction, global signal regression, and temporal filtering are performed sequentially. In this work, we focus primarily on rs-fMRI. We illustrate the problem both theoretically and empirically through application to a test\textendash retest rs-fMRI data set, and suggest remedies. These include (a) combining all steps into a single linear filter, or (b) sequential orthogonalization of covariates/linear filters performed in series.},

At a time when the availability of fMRI data is rapidly growing-primarily through large, publicly available grassroots datasets-automated quality control and outlier detection methods are greatly needed. We propose principal components analysis (PCA) leverage and demonstrate how it can be used to identify outlying time points in an fMRI run. Furthermore, PCA leverage is a measure of the influence of each observation on the estimation of principal components, which are often of interest in fMRI data. We also propose an alternative measure, PCA robust distance, which is less sensitive to outliers and has controllable statistical properties. The proposed methods are validated through simulation studies and are shown to be highly accurate. We also conduct a reliability study using resting-state fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and find that removal of outliers using the proposed methods results in more reliable estimation of subject-level resting-state networks using independent components analysis.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) data are subject to artifacts from a myriad of sources which can have negative consequences on the accuracy and power of statistical analyses. Scrubbing is a technique for excluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts. Here we present "projection scrubbing", a new data-driven scrubbing method based on a statistical outlier detection framework. Projection scrubbing consists of two main steps: projection of the data onto directions likely to represent artifacts, and quantitative comparison of each volume's association with artifactual directions to identify volumes exhibiting artifacts. We assess the ability of projection scrubbing to improve the reliability and predictiveness of functional connectivity (FC) compared with two popular scrubbing methods: motion scrubbing, a measure of subject head displacement, and DVARS, another data-driven measure based on signal intensity change in the fMRI scan. We perform scrubbing in conjunction with regression-based denoising through CompCor, which we found to outperform alternative methods. Projection scrubbing and DVARS were both substantially more beneficial to FC reliability than motion scrubbing, illustrating the advantage of data-driven measures over head motion-based measures for identifying contaminated volumes. The benefit of scrubbing was strongest for connections between subcortical regions and cortical-subcortical connections. Scrubbing with any method did not have a noticeable effect on prediction accuracy of sex or total cognition, suggesting that the ultimate effect of scrubbing on downstream analysis depends on a number of factors specific to a given analysis. To promote the adoption of effective fMRI denoising techniques, all methods are implemented in a user-friendly, open-source R package that is compatible with NIFTI- and CIFTI-format data.},

These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

Despite the importance of the problem and the multitude of solutions proposed in literature, it comes as a surprise that there does not exist a coherent asymptotic framework, which would justify different approaches depending on the actual size of the dataset. In this article, we address this issue by presenting an approximate Bayesian approach based on Laplace approximation and introducing a general method of developing criteria for model selection, called PEnalized SEmi-integrated Likelihood (PESEL). Our general framework encompasses a variety of existing approaches based on probabilistic models, like the Bayesian Information Criterion for Probabilistic PCA (PPCA), and enables the construction of new criteria, depending on the size of the dataset at hand and additional prior information. Specifically, we apply PESEL to derive two new criteria for datasets where the number of variables substantially exceeds the number of observations, which is out of the scope of currently existing approaches. We also report results of extensive simulation studies and real data analysis, which illustrate the desirable properties of our proposed criteria as compared to state-of-the-art methods and very recent proposals. Specifically, these simulations show that PESEL-based criteria can be quite robust against deviations from the assumptions of a probabilistic model. Selected PESEL-based criteria for the estimation of the number of principal components are implemented in the R package pesel, which is available on github (https://github.com/psobczyk/pesel). Supplementary material for this article, with additional simulation results, is available online.

The trend filtering estimate is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which the penalty term sums the absolute \$k\$th order discrete derivatives over the input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to have the structure of \$k\$th degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen knot points (we say ``appear'' here as trend filtering estimates are not really functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387\textendash 413], which penalize the total variation of the \$k\$th derivative. Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for functions whose \$k\$th derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines, which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rate [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387\textendash 413]. At the core of this argument is a new result tying together the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but have different predictor matrices.},
